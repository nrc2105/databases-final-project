PA2 Part 2

Manifest:
Aardvark.java
Animal.java
Anteater.java
Anthill.java
BasicAnthill.java
PriorityScheduler.java
Test2.java

To compile and run simply execute 'javac Test2.java' followed by 'java Test2'.

 The majority of this program is identical to part 1.  The BasicAnthill
and all Animal classes are unchanged.  The new addition is the
PriorityScheduler class, which assesses the priority of each animal and
either allows it to attempt to eat at a hill, or if it does not have
the highest current waiting priority, to wait.  If there is no hill
currently available, all animals must wait.  When an animal exits a hill
notify is called to wake all waiting threads so that they may try again
to eat.  This will continue until all Animals have eaten.

No known unresolved bugs.

All of the work except that which was provided with the assignment
(Aardvark.java, Animal.java, Anteater.java, Anthill.java) are my own
and I have complied with all requirements of Academic Integrity.
